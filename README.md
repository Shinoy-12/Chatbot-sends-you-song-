# Chatbot-sends-you-song-
It's a funny ML based conversational chatbot which sends you list of song(link) based on your choice all these songs are stored in MySql Database . It is a very basic conversational bot but it will definitely help others to start building one.

RASA components for developing a ML based chatbot
RASA- An opensource bot building framework, is used to build this bot. RASA is divided into two major parts in terms of developing a chatbobt.

RASA NLU - Rasa NLU is an open-source natural language processing tool for intent classification, response retrieval and entity extraction in chatbots.

RASA CORE - It works as a dialogue management for bot and keeps track of a conversation with the user.

RASA NLU
nlu.md - consists training data for intent classification and entiity extraction

     ref:-https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/training-data-format/

RASA CORE
stories.md - Rasa stories are a form of training data used to train the Rasaâ€™s dialogue management models.

A story is a representation of a conversation between a user and an AI assistant, converted into a specific format where user inputs are expressed as corresponding intents (and entities where necessary) while the responses of an assistant are expressed as corresponding action names.

         ref:- https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/stories/

domain.yml - The Domain defines the universe in which your assistant operates. It specifies the intents, entities, slots, and actions your bot should know about. Optionally, it can also include responses for the things your bot can say.

         ref:- https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/domains/

configuration
config.yml - consists configuration pipeline for the training of NLU and CORE - Choosing an NLU and a CORE pipeline allows you to customize your model and finetune it on your dataset.
